  "description": "As an avid fan of movies and movie trivia, I want to create a web application to generate movie release date trivia questions. Users should be able to sign up for an account answer as many questions as they like and see statistics on how well they answer movie date questions. Users should be able to see their statistics compared to others on a leader board. Users will be able to upload specific lists exported from IMDB so users can do trivia on subsets of movies. This web application is to be completed by April 2022.",
